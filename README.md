# BawiKV
Experimental key-value store based on log-structure. 
Most of base logic is based on [cask](https://github.com/andresilva/cask) project, and guide from [pingcap/talent-plan](https://github.com/pingcap/talent-plan).

This project is for personal research, motivated by [build-your-own-x](https://github.com/danistefanovic/build-your-own-x) project.
